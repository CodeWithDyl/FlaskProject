    <h2>Story 1: The Little Red Riding Hood</h2>
    <p> 
        Once upon a time, 
        there was a little girl 
        named Little Red Riding Hood 
        who lived in a small village. 
        One day, her mother asked her 
        to take a basket of food to her 
        sick grandmother who lived in 
        the woods. As Little Red Riding 
        Hood walked through the forest, 
        she encountered a sly wolf who 
        asked her where she was going. 
        Little Red Riding Hood told the 
        wolf about her mission to visit her
        grandmother, and the wolf offered
        to show her the way. However, the
        wolf had other plans and decided to
        take a shortcut to the grandmother's
        house, arriving there before Little
        Red Riding Hood. When Little Red Riding
        Hood arrived at the house, she found 
        wolf in her grandmother's bed, disguised
        as the old woman. The wolf, seeing Little Red
        Riding Hood, leapt out of the bed and chased
        after her. Fortunately, a huntsman passing by
        heard Little Red Riding Hood's cries for help
        and came to her rescue, killing the wolf and
        saving the day.

    <h2>Story 2: The Three Little Pigs</h2>
    <p>
         There once were three little pigs
         who lived in a house made of straw.
        One day, a big bad wolf came along
        and blew down their house. The three
        little pigs ran away and decided to
        build new homes to protect themselves
        from the wolf. The first little pig
        built a house of straw, but the wolf
        blew it down just like before. The second
        little pig built a house of sticks, but
        the wolf blew it down as well. The third
        little pig, however, built a house of bricks,
        which was strong enough to withstand the wolf's
        blows. The wolf, unable to blow down the brick
        house, gave up and ran away. The three little
        pigs lived happily ever after in their brick house.
